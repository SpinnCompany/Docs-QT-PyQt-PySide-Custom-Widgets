title: Introducing the New Dashboard UI
---

We’re excited to introduce the **new modern Dashboard UI** for the *Docs-QT-PyQt-PySide-Custom-Widgets* project! 🎨  
It’s built with **PySide6**, styled for dark mode, and designed to provide a seamless development experience.

## 🚀 Highlights

Here’s what’s new in the Dashboard:

- **Responsive layout** with sidebar, header, and content sections.  
- **Dark mode** optimized interface.  
- **Quick actions** to create and manage blog posts easily.  
- **Tailwind-inspired design** for better visual consistency.  
- **Modular includes** for sidebar, header, and footer — making it easy to reuse across pages.

## 🧩 Technologies

The dashboard is powered by:
- **PySide6** for UI logic  
- **Tailwind CSS** for layout styling  
- **Jinja templates** for component structure  
- **Docusaurus** for the documentation and blog system

## 🛠️ Upcoming Features

Next, we’re adding:
- Markdown live preview for blog creation.  
- Automatic `.md` generation from the dashboard form.  
- Post synchronization with your hosted docs site at  
  👉 [qtcustomwidgets.spinncode.com/blog](https://qtcustomwidgets.spinncode.com/blog)

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This marks the beginning of a unified workflow — write, preview, and publish your documentation or blogs directly from the **Dashboard UI**.
