## Project Structure and Best Practices

Before you begin, consider using the [**Project Maker**](/API-Reference/ProjectMaker)
, a tool that creates a project following the recommended structure for the Custom Widgets module. This structure streamlines the setup, organization, and integration of widgets within your Qt application.

To learn more about the [**Project Maker**](/API-Reference/ProjectMaker) and other important updates, see the project structure [guide here](/API-Reference/ProjectMaker).
